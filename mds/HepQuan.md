**MS find** section provieds a friendly way to interactively search the corresponding structure of  low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparin/heparan sulfate oligosaccharides by  provided of LC-MS m/z and charge.


 1. Various types of LMWHs can be searched including Enoxaparin, Dalteparin and Nadroparin.  Heparan/HS with  degree of polymerisation <30 is also supported.
 
 3. MS find can be applied to 2 mosly used LMWH intact chain analysis methods HILIC and SEC.
	 - Method 1 HILIC: Li, Lingyun, et al. "Top-down approach for the direct characterization of low molecular weight heparins using LC-FT-MS." _Analytical chemistry_ 84.20 (2012): 8822-8829.
	 - Mehod 2 SEC-ion suppressor: Zaia, Joseph, et al. "Complete molecular weight profiling of low-molecular weight heparins using size exclusion chromatography-ion suppressor-high-resolution mass spectrometry." _Analytical chemistry_ 88.21 (2016): 10654-10660.

 3. We suggest to set ppm as 10 or less if LMWH is analyised by high resolution mass specmeter (such as Thermo Orbitrap XL, Thermo QE)

 4. For Enoxaparin, output are given as [ΔHexA, HexA, GlcN, Ac, SO3, 1,6-anhydro]-[Adductive], For Heparin/HS, output are given as [ΔHexA, HexA, GlcN, Ac, SO3]-[Adductive];for Method 1, the adductive is NH3, for Method 2, there is no adductive
